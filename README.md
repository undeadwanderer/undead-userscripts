# Undead Usersctipts
Some very bad and unfinished userscripts I made back in 2018. Basically baby's first (and last) userscripts. These weren't the only scripts I made by then but these three are confirmed to work presently.

License: Everything except for **tabun-filters** is under **Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0**, **tabun-filters** is under **WTFPL**.

Installation: Open the script code and click "raw", your script manager should recognize it.

**tabun-filters** — Post and comment filters for the MLP fansite tabun.everypony.ru. More information can be found at the script's folder.

**derpibooru-forum-filter** — Spoilers forum topics with "NSFW" in the title on Derpibooru (haven't implemented it for all pages yet). [Upd. 2024-02-18: Due to as of now using Mark Taiwan's gui library for the settings, __requires Violentmonkey__ if you're on Firefox. Said settings can be found in the "Userscripts" tab on the Settings page.]

**derpibooru-upload-tag** — Automatically fills in tags of your choice on the image upload page on Derpibooru, as of now uses Mark Taiwan's library so the note on the script above applies.

**derpibooru-upload-tag-legacy** — Fills in a "safe" tag on the new image upload page on Derpibooru. An older version of the script above that doesn't rely on Mark Taiwan's library or needs Violentmonkey to use on Firefox at the exchange of customizability (you can still edit the values in the code itself though).

**eqd-page-title-cleanup** — Retitles Equestria Daily's pages for convenience.
