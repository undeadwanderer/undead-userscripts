# Undead Usersctipts
Some very bad and unfinished userscripts I made back in 2018. Basically baby's first (and last) userscripts. These weren't the only scripts I made by then but these three are confirmed to work presently.

License: Everything is under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0, forum filter links Mark Taiwan's Derpi4U library licensed under MIT license as a requirement.

Releases: Open the script code and click "raw", your script manager should recognize it.

**derpibooru-forum-filter** — Spoilers forum topics with "NSFW" in the title on Derpibooru (haven't implemented it for all pages yet). [Upd. 2024-02-18: Due to as of now using Mark Taiwan's gui library for the settings, __requires Violentmonkey__ if you're on Firefox. Said settings can be found in the "Userscripts" tab on the Settings page.]

**derpibooru-upload-tag** — Fills in a "safe" tag on the new image upload page on Derpibooru (~~doesn't always work~~should work now).

**eqd-page-title-cleanup** — Retitles Equestria Daily's pages for convenience.
