# Undead Usersctipts
Some very bad and unfinished userscripts I made back in 2018. Basically baby's first (and last) userscripts. These weren't the only scripts I made by then but these three are confirmed to work presently.

License: I don't know a first thing about licenses so feel free to modify and redistribute, a credit would be nice, using for profit — won't.

Releases: I don't use github and I have no idea what I am doing, I just needed to store these somewhere else from my hard drive and personal cloud and hopefully publish them at some point. To install, open the script and click "raw", your userscript manager of choice should recognize it.

**derpibooru-forum-filter** — Spoilers forum topics with "NSFW" in title on Derpibooru (didn't implement it for all pages).

**derpibooru-upload-tag** — Fills in "safe" tag on new uploads on Derpibooru (doesn't always work).

**eqd-page-title-cleanup** — Retitles Equestria Daily's pages to be more convenient for bookmarking.
