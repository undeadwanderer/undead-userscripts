# Undead Usersctipts
Some very bad and unfinished userscripts I made back in 2018. Basically baby's first (and last) userscripts. These weren't the only scripts I made by then but these three are confirmed to work presently.

License: I don't know a first thing about licenses so feel free to modify and redistribute, a credit would be nice, using for profit — won't.

Releases: I don't use github and I have no idea what I am doing, I just needed to store these somewhere else from my hard drive and personal cloud and hopefully publish them at some point. To install, open the script and click "raw", your userscript manager of choice should recognize it.

**derpibooru-forum-filter** — Spoilers forum topics with "NSFW" in the title on Derpibooru (have't implemented it for all pages). [Upd. 2024-02-18: Due to as of late using Marker's gui library for settings, REQUIRES Violentmonkey if using Firefox. Said settings can be found in the "Userscripts" tab on the Settings page. Due to said library's limitations, only up to five filter words are currently supported, if you need more contact me.]

**derpibooru-upload-tag** — Fills in a "safe" tag on the new upload screen on Derpibooru (doesn't always work).

**eqd-page-title-cleanup** — Retitles Equestria Daily's pages for convenience.
