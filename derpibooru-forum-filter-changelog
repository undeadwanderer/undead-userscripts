// Changelog: 0.95d / 2024-04-20: Replaced Derpi4U library with a fork that supports multiline text areas; split the filter words with newline;
//                                Resetting the settings to default first things first is highly recommended.
//            0.95c / 2024-02-19: Figured out how to use a single textbox for all the filter words.
//            0.95b / 2024-02-18: Added Marker's Derpi4U script/library for the settings userface, the downside is that it doesn't allow array options so I've had to set a limited number of fields (5).
//                                Inform me if more filter words are needed and I'll adjust the script.
//            0.95a / 2024-02-18: Filter words list no longer requires regex values.
//            0.95  / 2024-02-18: Added support for multiple filter words [currently only accessible by modifying the variable directly].
//            0.94a / 2024-02-06: Bugfix (script was not working on /forums page if any last post boxes are empty (i.e. a post has been deleted)).
//            0.94:               Added /activity; Small code rewrites; Updated class selector for Notifications.
//            0.93a:              Bugfix (Anon posts in the sidebar still didn't work as intended in Firefox (plaintext code is enclosed in quotes in Opera but turned out not to be in FF)).
//            0.93:               Bugfix for the sidebar and Notifications (the script didn't filter a thread if the last poster was anonymous).
//            0.92:               Added Main page sidebar support [might be redundant because 'nsfw' seems to be filtered by default in the sidebar, might be useful for future keyword additions though].
//            0.91:               Reworked the replacement function to remove redundant lines from the 'notifications page' part of the code.
//            0.9:                Added Notifications page support.
//            0.82:               Testing Notifications page support.
//            0.81:               Code cleanup.
//            0.8:                First fully working version; only board list and thread list pages are supported.

// Considered future features:
// Profile pages support - TBD.
// Support for multiple filter words - implemented as of 0.95 but may need improvement.
// GUI and local storage for filters. - implemented as of 0.95b but uses the library's local storage.
// Forum search and user's forum history pages support - unlikely to be implemented in this script because they show posts instead of threads.
// JSON fetching of the current board list - maybe? (if possible?)

// Reminder of currently supported pages:
// Board list / Forums main page
// Board pages / Thread lists
// Main/Activity page with sidebar on
// Notifications
