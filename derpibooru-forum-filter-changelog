// Changelog: 0.94a: Quick bugfix (script was not working on /forums page if any last post boxes are empty (i.e. a post has been deleted)).
//            0.94:  Added /activity; Small code rewrites; Updated class selector for Notifications.
//            0.93a: Bugfix (Anon posts in the sidebar still didn't work as intended in Firefox (plaintext code is enclosed in quotes in Opera but turned out not to be in FF)).
//            0.93:  Bugfix for the sidebar and Notifications (the script didn't filter a thread if the last poster was anonymous).
//            0.92:  Added Main page sidebar support [might be redundant because 'nsfw' seems to be filtered by default in the sidebar, might be useful for future keyword additions though].
//            0.91:  Reworked the replacement function to remove redundant lines from the 'notifications page' part of the code.
//            0.9:   Added Notifications page support.
//            0.82:  Testing Notifications page support.
//            0.81:  Code cleanup.
//            0.8:   First fully working version; only board list and thread list pages are supported.

// Considered future features:
// Main page (sidebar) support - in progress (not enough unique selectors, have to figure out a workaround).
// Profile pages support - TBD.
// Support for multiple filter words - may be implemented but not a priority.
// Forum search page support - unlikely to be implemented in this script because they show posts instead of threads.
// JSON fetching of the current board list - maybe? (if possible?)
